# Space Invaders - How to Code Simple Data's final task
In this repository, I am making available my solution to the Space Invaders problem.

I have added some extra features not asked for:
- A GAME OVER screen when an invader gets to land
- The possibility to restart the game if the user reaches the GAME OVER screen by pressing 'R'
- Keeping score. Each killed invader is worth one point
- The rate of invader generation grows faster as the user has more points -> (INVADER-RATE - POINTS)
